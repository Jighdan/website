A few days ago, I met with a friend I've known for about 23 years - we hadn't seen each other in 4 years, but immediately as we met, there was this warm care present between us as we shared ice cream.

It didn't really matter whether they thought my decisions lacked principle or my sandals were a bit silly, as my sister suggests; nor did I feel a necessity for questioning why their hair was now red instead of light yellow as I remembered, beyond that they just liked it and thus changed it.

When I thought of endless possibilities of expression, I feared that if I were given enough room to be, I would be anything except myself, but when the opportunity came, the conclusion is the same: I am who I am.

Thanks for having friends.
