A few days ago I met with a friend that I've known for 23 years or so - we hadn't seen each other in 4 years but immediately as we met there was this warm care present between us sharing ice cream.

It didn't matter really whether they thought my decisions lacked principle or my sandals were a bit silly as my sister suggests; neither I felt a necessity for questioning why their hair was now red instead of light yellow as I remember beyond that they just liked it and thus they changed it.

When I thought of endless possibilities of expression, I feared that if I was given enough room to be I would be anything except myself, but when the opportunity came the conclusion is the same: I am who I am.

Thanks for having friends.
