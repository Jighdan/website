<!-- ## What defines you as a person, beyond your work?

I try to let my curiosity of things drive what I do. I love serving as a generative function in my friends lives. I enjoy being in nature. I try to be honest and present. -->

<!-- ## What are you most passionate about right now?

Getting to know myself better. I feel this is the root of many things for my experience and the ones close to me, so it would be a disservice not to seek to live good days. Whatever a good day means to me in the moment. -->

<!-- ## Where are you currently living, and how do you feel about it?

I'm currently living in Cabarete, Dominican Republic. It has been home for 6.5 years now. The easeness of living is very precious, the people and places are full of magic. I feel very grateful to be here. -->

<!-- ## What book or media are you currently enjoying?

Currently I have a few books that I'm reading alternately:
- What can a Body Do? by Sara Hendren
- The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin
- Iron John by Robert Bly
- Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke, the translation by Joanna Macy and Anita Barrows
- Vagabond by Takehiko Inoue, the manga, once again.

A good song that I can play and usually begin singing to is Ya Hey by Vampire Weekend. -->

<!-- ## Is there a new skill or subject you're learning about?

Practicing submission grappling. I have never practiced any kind of contact sports before, and it is so much fun and frustrating trying to solve puzzles with my body and against another person - while at the same time letting go of the thinking and just doing.  -->


## What kind of humor do you appreciate?

I find absurdity hilarious. I love when people are able to laugh at themselves. Also concious humor that attempts to draw a perspective and attention to problematic themes.

Truly love the Monthy Python and the Holy Grail, can watch it over and over again. Even the fact that some of my friends detest this film so much gifts laughter to my belly.
